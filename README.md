# basic-crud-pattern-python
This shows a basic homemade CRUD library that reads and writes json to text files. The point here is to see pep8, pyflakes and testify in action to verify the unit tests

Requirements:
python 3.8.5
testify
pyflakes3
pep8

Usage:
To set this up simply:
cd basic-crud-python && pep8 . && pyflakes . && testify test

I need to convert the testify stuff to pytest but I'll leave that for another day
